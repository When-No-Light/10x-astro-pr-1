## Project Description

**10x-cards** is a web application that empowers learners to generate and manage
spaced-repetition flashcards in seconds. By leveraging large language models via
Openrouter.ai, users can paste any text excerpt and receive AI-suggested
question-and-answer pairs. They can then accept, edit, or reject each card
before saving to their personal collection.

- Eliminates manual effort in creating high-quality flashcards  
- Supports manual creation, editing, and deletion of cards  
- Secure user authentication and GDPR-compliant data handling
